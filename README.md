Karashuta is a game that was developed during my 1. Semester at the [S4G School for Games](https://www.school4games.net/) using Gdscript and the Godot Engine. This was also the first game I developed as part of a team together with 5 other devs. You an check out the games website [here](https://karashuta.school4games.net/)

Karashuta is a top down bullet shooter at its core. The special thing is that you can switch your shield to absorb enemy bullets of the same color. But beware: Enemies use the same shield technology. 
Other features include:
- random run generation
- overcharge abilities that are build up by absorbing bullets
- unlock new Story pieces in the main hub throughout multiple runs
- Face a hardcore survival Arena at the end of each run
- Surviving 4 Arenas unlocks your way to the final boss and the Story conclusion

# How to run
You can find a release build version [here](https://s4g.itch.io/karashuta/devlog/500039/day-1-patch-lol). Alternatively clone this repo and open the project.godot file using Godot 3.5.1 .
